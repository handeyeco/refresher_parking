      <p>Refresher is a project that aspires to bring enthusiasm and fun to learning by "gamifying" core subjects. The approach is to take small, bite-sized lessons on non-trivial subject matters and present them in a trivia-like format. But the goal isn't just to reach students, it's to encourage everyone to continue - and be excited by - learning.</p>
